# Differential_Privacy_in_ML
This report and the code provided along, explains how to incorporate privacy in Naïve Bayes Classification using the theoretical concept of Differential Privacy. 
# About
This report first introduces the reader to the mathematical concept of differential privacy and how to incorporate it in the algorithm of Naïve Bayes Classifier using global sensitivity. Later, a modification is proposed to use local instead of global sensitivity which results in increase in accuracy of results.
After analysing the values for different values of privacy parameter, a trade-off between privacy and accuracy can also be established.
